# Documentation Strategy: Collaborative Futuristic Front-End

## 1. Purpose & Importance

Effective documentation is crucial for the long-term success, maintainability, and scalability of this collaborative front-end application. It ensures that:

*   **New contributors** can understand the codebase and get up to speed quickly.
*   **Team members** can effectively collaborate and understand different parts of the system.
*   **Future maintainers** (including our future selves) can make changes and fix bugs with confidence.
*   **Knowledge is shared** and not siloed within individuals.

This document outlines the strategy for creating and maintaining documentation throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Types of Documentation & Guidelines

### 2.1. Code Comments

Well-commented code is the first line of documentation. Comments should clarify *why* something is done, not just *what* is done (which should be evident from clear code).

*   **When to Comment:**
    *   Complex or non-obvious logic.
    *   Workarounds or reasons for choosing a less straightforward approach.
    *   Important business rules or constraints.
    *   The purpose of functions, classes, and significant blocks of code.
*   **Style & Format:**
    *   **JSDoc / TSDoc:** For all functions, methods, and complex type definitions. This is especially important for TypeScript projects.
        *   Describe the function's purpose.
        *   Document each parameter (`@param {type} name - description`).
        *   Document the return value (`@returns {type} - description`).
        *   Document any thrown errors (`@throws {ErrorType} - condition`).
    *   **Inline Comments:** Use `//` for single-line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments where appropriate.
    *   **TODO / FIXME:** Use standard markers like `// TODO: Description` or `// FIXME: Description` to highlight areas that need future attention. These can often be tracked by IDEs or linters.

**Example (TSDoc):**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the sum of two numbers.
 * @param a - The first number.
 * @param b - The second number.
 * @returns The sum of a and b.
 */
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

/**
 * Represents a user in the system.
 */
interface UserProfile {
  /** The unique identifier for the user. */
  id: string;
  /** The display name of the user. */
  displayName: string;
  /** Optional email address. */
  email?: string;
}
```

### 2.2. Component Documentation (`src/components/`)

Reusable UI components are fundamental to the application. Their documentation should make them easy to understand and use.

*   **In-File Documentation:**
    *   Each component file (e.g., `Button.tsx`) should start with a brief TSDoc comment explaining its purpose and general usage.
    *   **Props Documentation:** Define props using TypeScript interfaces with clear TSDoc descriptions for each prop.
        ```typescript
        interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
          /**
           * Specifies the button's visual style.
           * @default 'primary'
           */
          variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost' | 'link';
          /**
           * How large should the button be?
           * @default 'md'
           */
          size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
          /**
           * If true, the button will take up the full width of its container.
           * @default false
           */
          fullWidth?: boolean;
        }
        ```
*   **Interactive Component Showcasing (Future Goal - Storybook):**
    *   **Tool:** We plan to integrate [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for creating an interactive component library.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   Visually browse and test components in isolation.
        *   Document different states and variants of each component.
        *   Provides a living style guide and component library.
    *   **When to Implement:** This will be considered as the component library grows and matures.

### 2.3. High-Level Project Documentation (Root Markdown Files)

The markdown documents created in the root directory of the repository serve as the primary source for high-level project understanding:

*   **`README.md` (in `collaborative-frontend`):** Entry point for developers.
*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md` (in `collaborative-frontend`):** Guidelines for contributing.
*   **`PROJECT_SCOPE.md`:** Project vision, features, users.
*   **`TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md`:** Technology choices and rationale.
*   **`DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`:** UI/UX design principles.
*   **`USABILITY_TESTING_PLAN.md`:** Strategy for usability evaluation.
*   **`PERFORMANCE_GUIDELINES.md`:** Performance optimization strategies.
*   **`ACCESSIBILITY_GUIDELINES.md`:** Accessibility standards and practices.

These documents should be reviewed and updated as the project evolves.

### 2.4. Architectural Decisions

Significant architectural decisions, patterns, or the rationale behind choosing specific libraries/approaches should be documented.

*   **Location:**
    *   For broad architectural decisions, a dedicated `docs/architecture/` directory could be created in the `collaborative-frontend` folder.
    *   Alternatively, decisions specific to a module can be documented in a `README.md` within that module's directory (e.g., `src/lib/realtime/README.md`).
*   **Content:**
    *   What problem was being solved?
    *   What options were considered?
    *   Why was the chosen solution selected (trade-offs)?
    *   Potential future considerations or implications.

### 2.5. API Documentation (If Applicable)

If the Next.js application exposes its own API routes (e.g., under `src/app/api/`) that are intended for consumption by external clients or other services:

*   **Tool:** Consider using [OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger)](https://swagger.io/specification/) to define and document these APIs.
*   **Next.js Integration:** Tools like `next-swagger-doc` can help generate OpenAPI definitions from JSDoc comments in your API route handlers.
*   **Content:** Document endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication methods, and rate limits.

### 2.6. Setup and Deployment

*   **`README.md`:** The main `README.md` in `collaborative-frontend` covers basic setup.
*   **Deployment Guide (Future):** As the project matures and deployment processes are established (e.g., to Vercel, AWS), a `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide will be created detailing the steps, environment variables, and any specific configurations required for different environments (development, staging, production).

## 3. Keeping Documentation Up-to-Date

Outdated documentation can be worse than no documentation. Maintaining accuracy is key.

*   **Documentation as Part of Development:**
    *   Updating documentation should be an integral part of the development workflow.
    *   When a feature is added or changed, the relevant documentation (code comments, component docs, architectural notes, READMEs) must be updated in the same pull request.
*   **Pull Request Reviews:**
    *   Reviewers should check for documentation updates alongside code changes.
    *   PR templates can include a checklist item for documentation.
*   **Regular Audits (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Periodically review key documentation (especially high-level documents and critical component docs) to ensure they are still accurate and relevant.
*   **"Documentation Debt":**
    *   If documentation cannot be updated immediately, create a `// TODO: DOCS ...` comment or a technical debt ticket to track the required update.

By following this strategy, we aim to create and maintain a well-documented codebase that supports effective collaboration, development, and long-term maintenance of the Collaborative Futuristic Front-End application.
