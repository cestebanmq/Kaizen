# Project Scope: Collaborative Front-End

## 1. Core Collaborative Features

*   **Real-time Text Editing:** Users can edit documents simultaneously, with changes reflected in real-time for all collaborators (similar to Google Docs).
*   **Shared Cursors/Presence Indicators:** Visual cues (e.g., named cursors, avatars) will indicate the presence and current editing location of other users within the document.
*   **Commenting System:** Users can select specific parts of the content (text, images, etc.) and add comments or annotations. These comments will be visible to other collaborators and allow for threaded discussions.
*   **Basic Version History/Activity Log:** The system will track changes made to the document, allowing users to view a log of activities and potentially revert to previous versions.

## 2. Target Users & Devices

*   **Primary Users:** Teams of individuals working collaboratively on shared documents, creative projects, code, or any text-based content. This includes writers, editors, designers, developers, and project managers.
*   **Primary Devices:**
    *   **Mobile:** Smartphones (iOS and Android)
    *   **Tablets:** (iOS and Android)
    *   **Desktop Browsers:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
*   **Cross-Device Experience:** The application must provide a seamless and consistent experience across all supported device types, adapting its layout and interactions appropriately (mobile-first approach).

## 3. Aesthetic & User Experience (Futuristic & Innovative)

*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Interface:** Clean, minimalist, and uncluttered design.
    *   **Theme:** Dark mode by default to reduce eye strain and provide a modern feel. Users will be able to customize accent colors to personalize their experience.
    *   **Animations & Transitions:** Subtle and smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience without being distracting.
    *   **Iconography & Illustrations:** Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) will be used for all icons and illustrations to ensure sharpness on all displays and maintain a modern aesthetic.
*   **Interactions:**
    *   **Mobile:** Intuitive touch gestures for common actions (e.g., swipe to delete, pinch to zoom).
    *   **Desktop:** Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for power users to enhance efficiency.
    *   **Micro-interactions:** Small, delightful visual or auditory feedback for user actions (e.g., button clicks, successful operations) that are informative but not intrusive.
*   **Innovation (Future Goals & Exploration):**
    *   **AI-Powered Suggestions:** Placeholder for future integration of AI to provide content suggestions, grammar checks, or automated summaries.
    *   **Voice Command Integration:** Explore the possibility of voice commands for actions like "save document," "add comment," or "navigate to section."
    *   **Dynamic Layouts:** Investigate layouts that intelligently adapt not just to screen size, but also to the type of content being edited and individual user behavior or preferences.

## 4. Usability Goals

*   **Easy to Learn and Use:** The interface should be intuitive, requiring minimal onboarding for new users. Help documentation and tutorials should be easily accessible.
*   **Efficient for Common Tasks:** Core collaborative tasks (editing, commenting, sharing) should be streamlined and quick to perform.
*   **Clear Feedback and Error Prevention:** The system will provide clear and timely feedback for user actions. Proactive error prevention measures will be implemented, along with helpful error messages when issues do occur. Users should feel in control and understand the system's state.
