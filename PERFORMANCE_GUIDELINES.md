# Performance Guidelines: Collaborative Front-End

## 1. Introduction & Goals

Performance is a critical aspect of the user experience for our collaborative front-end application. A fast, responsive, and efficient application leads to higher user engagement, satisfaction, and improved accessibility, especially for users on less powerful devices or slower network connections.

**Goals:**

*   **Fast Initial Load:** Users should experience a quick initial page load, allowing them to start interacting with the application as soon as possible.
*   **Smooth Interactions:** All user interactions, including typing, navigating, animations, and transitions, should be fluid and free of jank.
*   **Efficient Resource Utilization:** The application should be mindful of CPU, memory, and network usage to ensure it runs well on a variety of devices and doesn't drain battery life unnecessarily.
*   **Responsiveness on All Devices:** Performance optimizations must consider the diverse range of target devices, with a particular focus on delivering a good experience on mobile.

## 2. Key Performance Metrics (Web Vitals & Others)

We will primarily focus on Google's Core Web Vitals, along with other key metrics:

*   **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):**
    *   **Description:** Measures loading performance. Marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded.
    *   **Target:** **< 2.5 seconds.**
*   **First Input Delay (FID) / Interaction to Next Paint (INP):**
    *   **Description:**
        *   FID: Measures interactivity. Quantifies the experience users feel when trying to interact with unresponsive pages. (Being replaced by INP).
        *   INP: Assesses overall responsiveness to user interactions by observing the latency of all click, tap, and keyboard interactions throughout the lifespan of a user's visit to a page.
    *   **Target:** **FID < 100ms.** Monitor **INP** and aim for "good" thresholds (typically < 200ms).
*   **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):**
    *   **Description:** Measures visual stability. Quantifies how much unexpected layout shift users experience.
    *   **Target:** **< 0.1.**
*   **Time to First Byte (TTFB):**
    *   **Description:** Measures server responsiveness. Identifies when a server sends the first byte of data back to the browser.
    *   **Target:** Keep server response times as low as possible (ideally < 200ms for dynamic content, much lower for cached/static content).
*   **Bundle Sizes:**
    *   **Description:** The size of JavaScript (and CSS) bundles directly impacts load time and parse/compile time.
    *   **Target:** Monitor and keep as small as possible. Use tools like `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify large dependencies. Aim for initial JS load < 200-250KB gzipped.
*   **Rendering Performance:**
    *   **Description:** Smoothness of animations, scrolling, and transitions.
    *   **Target:** Aim for **60 frames per second (FPS)** to ensure visual fluidity. Avoid long tasks that block the main thread.

## 3. Optimization Strategies (Leveraging Next.js & General Best Practices)

*   **Code Splitting:**
    *   **Next.js Automatic:** Next.js automatically splits JavaScript into smaller chunks on a per-page basis.
    *   **Dynamic Imports:** Use `next/dynamic` for components or libraries that are not needed for the initial paint, are below the fold, or are triggered by specific user interactions (e.g., modals, heavy charting libraries).
        ```javascript
        import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
        const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyComponent'))
        ```

*   **Lazy Loading:**
    *   **Images:** Utilize the `next/image` component, which provides automatic lazy loading (`loading="lazy"` by default when appropriate), optimization, and responsive sizing.
    *   **Components:** Lazy load offscreen components or sections using `next/dynamic` or Intersection Observer API if more custom control is needed.

*   **Image Optimization:**
    *   **`next/image`:** This is the preferred method. It handles:
        *   Automatic resizing and optimization.
        *   Serving images in modern formats like WebP where supported.
        *   Preventing layout shift by reserving space for images.
    *   **Manual Compression:** If not using `next/image`, ensure images are compressed effectively using tools like ImageOptim or TinyPNG.
    *   **Responsive Images:** Use the `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute for art direction or when `next/image` isn't suitable.

*   **Asset Minification & Compression:**
    *   **Next.js Defaults:** Next.js automatically minifies JavaScript and CSS in production builds.
    *   **Server Compression:** Ensure the hosting environment (e.g., Vercel, Node.js server) enables HTTP compression (Gzip or Brotli) for all text-based assets (HTML, CSS, JS, SVG).

*   **Caching:**
    *   **Browser Caching:** Static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts) should have appropriate `Cache-Control` headers to be cached by the browser. Next.js handles this well for its static assets.
    *   **Next.js Caching:**
        *   **SSG/ISR:** Pages generated at build time or incrementally are cached by default.
        *   **SSR:** Configure caching headers (`Cache-Control`) for server-rendered responses as appropriate.
        *   **Data Caching:** Consider caching strategies for API responses (e.g., using SWR or React Query with Next.js).

*   **Efficient State Management (Zustand):**
    *   **Selective Subscriptions:** Components should select only the slices of state they need to minimize re-renders.
        ```javascript
        // Good: Select only what's needed
        const userName = useStore(state => state.user.name);
        ```
    *   **Avoid Over-Storing:** Do not store all data globally if it's only used by a small part of the application or can be derived. Keep the global store lean.

*   **Memoization (React):**
    *   **`React.memo`:** Wrap functional components in `React.memo` to prevent re-renders if their props haven't changed.
        ```javascript
        const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) { /* ... */ });
        ```
    *   **`useMemo`:** Memoize the result of expensive calculations.
    *   **`useCallback`:** Memoize functions passed as props to child components to prevent them from causing unnecessary re-renders in memoized children.

*   **Debouncing and Throttling:**
    *   **Debounce:** For events that fire rapidly, like typing in a search box, use debouncing to delay function execution until after a pause.
    *   **Throttle:** For events like window resize, scroll, or real-time cursor updates, use throttling to limit the rate at which a function is called. This is crucial for `cursor_position` in our collaborative app.

*   **Tree Shaking:**
    *   Relies on ES6 module syntax (`import`/`export`). Next.js and Webpack handle this automatically.
    *   Ensure libraries used also support tree shaking. Avoid importing entire libraries if only a few functions are needed and specific imports are available.

*   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Site Generation (SSG) with Next.js:**
    *   **SSG (`getStaticProps`):** Best for pages where content can be determined at build time (e.g., marketing pages, blog posts). Provides fast TTFB.
    *   **SSR (`getServerSideProps`):** For pages where content must be fresh on every request. Balances dynamic content with server rendering benefits.
    *   **ISR (`getStaticProps` with `revalidate`):** A hybrid approach. Pages are statically generated but can be updated in the background after a certain interval.

*   **Font Loading Optimization:**
    *   **`next/font`:** This is the recommended approach in Next.js. It optimizes local fonts and Google Fonts, providing:
        *   Automatic self-hosting of fonts.
        *   No layout shift due to font loading.
        *   `font-display: optional` or other strategies can be applied.
    *   **Limit Fonts:** Minimize the number of custom web fonts and their weights/styles to reduce download size and rendering complexity.

## 4. Real-Time Performance (Socket.IO)

Optimizing real-time communication is crucial for a smooth collaborative experience:

*   **Message Payloads:**
    *   **Minimize Data:** Send only the essential data in Socket.IO messages. Avoid transmitting large, unnecessary objects.
    *   **Delta Updates:** For complex objects, consider sending only the changes (deltas) rather than the entire object on each update, if applicable (e.g., for large document structures).
*   **Serialization:**
    *   **JSON:** Typically sufficient and easy to work with.
    *   **Protocol Buffers / MessagePack:** If JSON parsing/serialization becomes a bottleneck with very high-frequency messages or extremely large payloads, consider binary formats. This adds complexity and is usually a later-stage optimization.
*   **Frequency of Updates:**
    *   **Throttling:** As mentioned, throttle high-frequency events like cursor movements. Determine an acceptable refresh rate that feels real-time without overwhelming the server or clients.
    *   **Batching:** For certain types of updates, consider batching multiple small changes into a single message if it makes sense for the feature.
*   **Server Load:** Monitor server CPU and memory usage as the number of concurrent connections grows. Scale server resources as needed.

## 5. Performance Monitoring & Profiling Tools

Regularly monitor and profile the application to identify and address performance bottlenecks:

*   **Browser DevTools:**
    *   **Lighthouse Tab:** Audit for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. Provides actionable recommendations.
    *   **Performance Tab:** Profile runtime performance, identify long tasks, analyze JavaScript execution, and detect rendering bottlenecks.
    *   **Network Tab:** Analyze asset loading, sizes, and timing.
*   **Next.js Analytics:**
    *   If deployed on Vercel and opted-in, provides real-user monitoring (RUM) for Core Web Vitals.
*   **External Web Performance Testing Tools:**
    *   **WebPageTest:** In-depth performance analysis from various locations and devices.
    *   **GTmetrix:** Performance insights and recommendations.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM) & Error Tracking:**
    *   **Sentry, Datadog, New Relic:** For monitoring performance issues, tracking errors, and understanding user experience in production.
*   **Bundle Analyzers:**
    *   **`@next/bundle-analyzer`:** Visualize the contents of your JavaScript bundles to identify large modules or duplicated dependencies.
        ```bash
        # Add to package.json scripts
        "analyze": "cross-env ANALYZE=true next build"
        ```

## 6. Mobile-First Considerations

Mobile performance requires special attention due to typically slower networks and less powerful CPUs:

*   **Optimize for Slower Networks:**
    *   Keep bundle sizes small.
    *   Aggressively use code splitting and lazy loading.
    *   Test on throttled network conditions (e.g., using Chrome DevTools network throttling).
*   **Optimize for Less Powerful CPUs:**
    *   Minimize expensive JavaScript execution.
    *   Be mindful of complex animations or computations.
    *   Profile CPU usage on target mobile devices.
*   **Test on Real Devices:**
    *   While emulators are useful, testing on a range of real mobile devices provides the most accurate performance insights.

By adhering to these guidelines and continuously monitoring performance, we aim to deliver a collaborative front-end application that is not only feature-rich but also exceptionally fast and enjoyable to use for all users across all supported devices. This document should be considered a living guide and updated as new best practices and tools emerge.
