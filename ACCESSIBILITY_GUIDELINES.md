# Accessibility Guidelines: Collaborative Front-End

## 1. Introduction & Goals

Accessibility is a fundamental aspect of creating inclusive digital products. It involves designing and developing our collaborative front-end application so that it can be used by everyone, including people with disabilities. This not only fulfills ethical and legal obligations but also enhances overall usability for all users.

*   **Importance:**
    *   **Ethical:** Ensuring equal access and opportunity for people with disabilities.
    *   **Legal:** Adhering to accessibility laws and standards (e.g., ADA, EN 301 549).
    *   **Usability Benefits:** Practices that improve accessibility often improve the experience for all users (e.g., clear navigation, readable text, keyboard compatibility).
*   **Goal:** Strive for **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA** compliance as a baseline for all features and content.
*   **Commitment:** We are committed to inclusive design principles throughout the product lifecycle, from design and development to testing and iteration.

## 2. Key Accessibility Principles (POUR)

These four principles are the foundation of WCAG and accessible design:

### Perceivable
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

*   **Text Alternatives:** Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language.
    *   **Guidance:** Use meaningful `alt` text for images (via `next/image`). For decorative images, use `alt=""`. Complex images may need longer descriptions.
*   **Sufficient Color Contrast:** Ensure that text and interactive elements have sufficient color contrast against their background.
    *   **Guidance:** Refer to `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` for theme considerations (dark mode, accent colors). Use contrast checking tools to meet WCAG AA ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Provide alternatives if users struggle with default themes.
*   **Adaptable Content:** Create content that can be presented in different ways (e.g., simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
    *   **Guidance:** Implement responsive design to ensure layouts adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. Allow users to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

### Operable
User interface components and navigation must be operable.

*   **Keyboard Accessibility:** All functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.
    *   **Guidance:** Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, custom components) are focusable and actionable using the keyboard.
*   **Clear Focus Indicators:** Provide clearly visible focus indicators for interactive elements.
    *   **Guidance:** Utilize Tailwind CSS focus utilities (e.g., `focus:ring`, `focus:outline`) to create distinct focus styles that align with the application's aesthetic.
*   **Avoid Keyboard Traps:** If keyboard focus can be moved to a component using the keyboard, then focus must be able to be moved away from that component using only the keyboard.
*   **Meaningful Link Text:** The purpose of each link should be clear from its text alone, or from its text and its programmatic context.
    *   **Guidance:** Avoid generic link text like "Click here" or "Learn more" without context.
*   **Sufficient Time:** Provide users enough time to read and use content.
    *   **Guidance:** Avoid timed interactions where possible. If time limits are necessary (e.g., session timeouts), provide options to extend or adjust them.

### Understandable
Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.

*   **Readable & Understandable Text:** Make text content readable and understandable.
    *   **Guidance:** Use clear and concise language. Employ good typography (legible fonts, sufficient line spacing, clear hierarchy) as outlined in `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`.
*   **Predictable Operation:** Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
    *   **Guidance:** Ensure consistent navigation and component behavior throughout the application. Changes in context should be initiated by user request or clearly indicated.
*   **Error Avoidance & Correction:** Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
    *   **Guidance:** Provide clear instructions, input validation, and helpful error messages. For form errors, identify the field in error and suggest corrections.

### Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

*   **Valid HTML & ARIA:** Use valid HTML according to specification. For custom components and dynamic content, use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes correctly to define roles, states, and properties.
    *   **Guidance:** Validate HTML. Use ARIA to bridge gaps where semantic HTML alone isn't sufficient for complex UI interactions (e.g., custom dropdowns, real-time updates).
*   **Assistive Technology Compatibility:** Ensure the application works with common assistive technologies like screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS) and screen magnifiers.

## 3. Specific Implementation Guidance

*   **Semantic HTML:**
    *   Use HTML elements for their intended purpose to provide inherent meaning and structure.
    *   Examples: `<nav>` for navigation blocks, `<main>` for primary content, `<aside>` for complementary content, `<button>` for actions, `<article>`, `<section>`, headings (`<h1>`-`<h6>`) in logical order.
*   **ARIA Attributes:**
    *   Use ARIA roles (e.g., `role="dialog"`, `role="alert"`, `role="tablist"`) to define the purpose of custom components.
    *   Use ARIA states and properties (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-hidden`, `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) to convey the state and properties of UI elements.
    *   **Real-time updates:** Use `aria-live` regions (e.g., `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"`) to announce dynamic content changes (new messages, collaborator status) to screen reader users.
    *   **Collaborative elements:** Custom collaborative elements (e.g., shared cursors, presence indicators) may require specific ARIA attributes to be understandable by assistive technologies.
*   **Forms:**
    *   Associate labels with all form inputs explicitly using `<label htmlFor="inputId">` and matching `id` on the input.
    *   Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and provide a descriptive title using `<legend>`.
    *   Provide clear, accessible error messages and validation feedback, associating errors with specific fields using `aria-describedby` if necessary.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:**
    *   Maintain a logical tab order for interactive elements, typically matching the visual flow.
    *   Ensure all custom interactive components (dropdowns, modals, tabs, custom menus) are fully keyboard operable (e.g., using arrow keys for selection, Escape to close).
*   **Images:**
    *   Use the `next/image` component for optimized image delivery.
    *   Provide descriptive `alt` text for all informative images.
    *   For purely decorative images, use an empty `alt=""` attribute.
*   **Dynamic Content & Real-Time Updates:**
    *   Use `aria-live` regions effectively. For chat messages or important notifications, `aria-live="polite"` is often appropriate. For urgent alerts, `aria-live="assertive"` might be used sparingly.
    *   Use `aria-atomic="true"` if the entire live region should be announced as a whole when any part changes.
    *   Use `aria-relevant` to specify what types of changes should be announced (e.g., `additions`, `text`, `removals`, `all`).
    *   Ensure that dynamic updates do not unexpectedly shift focus or disrupt the user's current task.
*   **Responsive Design:**
    *   Ensure that the layout reflows appropriately on different screen sizes and orientations without loss of content or functionality.
    *   Test readability and usability on small screens, including touch targets.

## 4. Testing & Tools

A combination of manual and automated testing is essential.

*   **Manual Testing:**
    *   **Keyboard-Only Navigation:** Navigate through the entire application using only the keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys, Escape). Verify all interactive elements are focusable and operable.
    *   **Screen Reader Testing:** Test with common screen readers:
        *   NVDA (Windows - free)
        *   VoiceOver (macOS/iOS - built-in)
        *   JAWS (Windows - commercial, for broader testing if possible)
    *   **Text Zooming:** Zoom browser text up to 200% to ensure content remains readable and functional without horizontal scrolling.
    *   **Color Contrast Checks:** Use browser developer tools or dedicated contrast checker tools.
*   **Automated Tools:**
    *   **Browser Extensions:**
        *   Axe DevTools (by Deque)
        *   WAVE (by WebAIM)
    *   **Linters:**
        *   `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`: This is typically included by default with `create-next-app` and helps catch accessibility issues in JSX during development.
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** Consider integrating automated accessibility checks into the build pipeline.
*   **User Testing:**
    *   Actively include users with a range of disabilities in usability testing sessions, as outlined in the `USABILITY_TESTING_PLAN.md`. Their feedback is invaluable for identifying real-world accessibility barriers.

## 5. Futuristic UI Considerations

While aiming for an innovative and "futuristic" UI (as per `DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`), accessibility must not be compromised.

*   **Animations & Motion:**
    *   Respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query. Provide options to disable or reduce non-essential animations for users sensitive to motion.
    *   Ensure animations do not convey critical information exclusively.
*   **Complex Visuals:**
    *   If complex visualizations or non-standard interactive elements are used, ensure they have accessible alternatives or are described adequately for assistive technologies.
    *   Consider the cognitive load of highly dynamic or visually dense interfaces.
*   **Color & Themes:**
    *   While dark mode and custom accent colors are part of the aesthetic, ensure that high contrast options are available and that default themes meet contrast requirements.

This document will serve as a living guide, updated as the application evolves and new accessibility best practices emerge. Regular reviews and commitment from the entire team are crucial for building a truly accessible and inclusive collaborative front-end.
